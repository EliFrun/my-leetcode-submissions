# myleetcodesubmissions

This repository auto-syncs my submissions to leetcode questions    

I created this repository as a way to help showcase my ability to solve random algorithm implementation questions as well as to safe keep my solutions for future reference

My goto language when it comes to solving these problems is `python` but I do use `java`, `javascript`, `golang` and sometimes, if im feeling particularly bored, I will use `C`. Additionally, there are a few questions that I have solved that involved `SQL` queries, so I guess that counts too(although I don't really consider `SQL` a formal programming language).

Generally, my philosophy for these questions is the following:
* If the question is in the `easy` catagory, I will try solving it in as few lines as possible, even if it sacrifices performance.
* If the question is in the `medium` catagory, I will usually create a some what unreadable mess that works fairly optimally
* If the question is in the `hard` catagory, I will try to make it readable, and include comment and annotations to ensure I can read it when I review it again
